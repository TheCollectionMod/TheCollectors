# You may find this .hjson file approach to translations easier for your mod.
# .hjson files contain translations for the language specified in the filename. (Make sure this file is UTF-8 encoded only.)
# The possible languages are: English ("en-US"), German ("de-DE"), Italian ("it-IT"), French ("fr-FR"), Spanish ("es-ES"), Russian ("ru-RU"), Chinese ("zh-Hans"), Portuguese ("pt-BR"), and Polish ("pl-PL")
# Here in ExampleMod we have organized these files in a folder called Localization. A single file per language makes it extremely easy to to integrate and maintain translations.
# Each translation entry in .hjson files contains a key and a value. The key is determined following the rules of JSON [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp]
# The Key automatically inherits "Mods.ModNameHere.", which is useful to know if you want to use substitutions (as seen in the Paper Airplane example) or use Language.GetTextValue or Network text.
# The following are the currently autogenerated keys: ItemName, ItemTooltip, BuffName, BuffDescription, ProjectileName, NPCName, MapObject, and Prefix

					FarFromHome: I'm feeling a tad too far from home, like a stray cat without its scratchin' post.
					LoveSpace: But on the bright side, having so much space is like hitting the jackpot at the Candy Elves' family game night! It's roomier than a kangaroo's pouch, and I'm as pleased as punch about it, I am!
					DislikeCrowded: Golly gee, I'm not too keen on how crowded things are around me. It's like a beehive on Candy Elves' Folly Farm during honey season!
